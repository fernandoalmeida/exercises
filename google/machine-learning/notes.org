** Description

A supervised machine learning systems learn how to combine input to produce
useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

** Terminology

- *label* is the thing we are predicting;
- *feature* is an input variable;
- *example*
  - is a particular instance of data;
  - is categorized as labed examples and unlabled examples;
- *model*
  - defines the relationship between features and labels;
  - labled examples are used to *train* the model;
  - it is important to check how reliable your data is;
  - the labels applied to some examples may not be trusted;
  - a trained model is used to predict the label on unlabled examples;
- *training* means creating or *learning* a model;
- *inference* means applying a trained model to unlabled examples;
- a *regression* model predicts continuous values;
- a *classification* predicts discrete values;
- *linear regression* is a method for finding the straight line or hyperplane
  that best fits a set of points;
- *loss* is how well our line is doing at predicting any given example, is the
  penality for a bad prediction;

** Learning from data

- there are a lot of complex ways to learn from data, but starting simple will
  open the door to broadly useful methods;
- the equation generally has a shape like `y = wx + b`
- a convenient loss function for regression is *squared error* (also called *L2
  loss*), that calculates the square of the difference between prediction and
  true value: (label-prediction)^2 or (y-y')^2;
- Defining L2 loss on a data set we sum the loss of examples in the training set
  (sometimes is useful to define the mean square error - MSE, to calculate MSE,
  we sum up all the squared losses and then divide by the number of examples);
- by convention in machine learning, we write the equation for a model in the
  format y' = b + wx where:
  y' is the predicted layer;
  b is the bias;
  w is a vector representing the weight of the features;
  x is a vector representing the features;
- training a model means define good values for all the weights and bias from
  labeled examples.
- in *supervised learning*, a machine learning algorithm examines many examples
  to build a model (finding a set weights and biases) minimizing the loss
  (having low loss, on average, across all examples);
