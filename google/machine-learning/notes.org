** Description

A supervised machine learning systems learn how to combine input to produce
useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

** Terminology:

- *label* is the thing we are predicting;
- *feature* is an input variable;
- *example*
  - is a particular instance of data;
  - is categorized as labed examples and unlabled examples;
- *model*
  - defines the relationship between features and labels;
  - labled examples are used to *train* the model;
  - it is important to check how reliable your data is;
  - the labels applied to some examples may not be trusted;
  - a trained model is used to predict the label on unlabled examples;
- *training* means creating or *learning* a model;
- *inference* means applying a trained model to unlabled examples;
- a *regression* model predicts continuous values;
- a *classification* predicts discrete values;
