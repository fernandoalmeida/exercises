Data Flip Flop
  remember the state (t-1)
  clocked data flip flop
    - in, out
    - return the previous input (t-1)
    - sequential (bottom triangle)
  bit
    - in, out, load
    - combinatorial
  register
    - an abstraction for 16 bits (improved flip flop)

RAM
  - sequence of addressable registers (0 to n-1)
  - only one register may be selected (at any point of time)
  - in, address, load, out
  - word width (in Hack w = 16)
  - width of address input (k = logÂ²n)
    - n:8 = k:3
    - n:64 = k:6
    - n:512 = k:9
  - sequential chip

Program Counter (PC)
  - used to track which instruction should be fethed and executed next
  - operations: reset (PC = 0), next (PC++), goto (PC = n)
  - in, load, inc, reset, out
